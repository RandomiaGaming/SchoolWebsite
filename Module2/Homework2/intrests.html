                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of this class I do a lot of coding on other projects mostly in the C# programming language.
                    I have been coding since I was like 10 and my dad first set me up with Scratch and Minecraft. Ever
                    since I have be facinated by coding and have made several games and apps using the Unity game engine
                    and Microsoft's XNA framwork.

                <h3>Game Engine</h3>
                <p>
                    My latest project is a custom game engine written from scratch using C++ and the Win32 APIs. This
                    game engine is my child and I have speant way to long on it. It's highly optimized for the best
                    possible framerates and gets about 6,000 FPS on my GTX 1660 with a Ryzen 5 3600.

                <p>
                    Best of all everything I coded is open source and availible for <b>free</b> on my

                <h3>Legally Required List</h3>
                <p>
                    I am legally obligated to include an ordered list. So here is a list of some foods I ate this week
                    in order of how good they were.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pizza - Pretty tasty and cheap too!</li>
                    <li>Hash Browns - Absolutely epic but I've gotten sick of eating them every day.</li>
                    <li>Beef Burger - Pretty good. Kinda expensive.</li>
                    <li>Tofu - It's like meat but it tastes nothing like it.</li>
                    <li>High Fiber Cereal - It's healthy so that makes it lame.</li>
                </ol>
