    <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        Website: A website is a unified collection of pages designed to be viewed with a web browser. A website is
        usually hosted by a server on a domain with various html files coorisponding to each page on the website.
        Websites also often contain css and javascript files to add additional functionality and customization to each
        page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Application: Similar to a website a web application is a set of files and code designed to be viewed in a
        web browser. However, web applications are often more interactive offering features like dynamic graphics and
        audio instead of just static text and links.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Browser: A web browser is a standalone application designed to preforms various web and internet related
        tasks including downloading pages and facilitating communications with a web server as well as its primary
        function to render and display html pages and execute javascript in a contained environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Server: A web server is an application designed to respond and process requests from a web client or web
        browser. A typical web server is able to handle many differing types of requests to download content or modify
        database values in response to client requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTTP Request: The HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is a set of standards for how a server and client will
        communicate and what requests/responses are allowed. An HTTP request is a part of the HTTP protocol which
        defines a request sent by the client to the server. A typical HTTP request might as the server for the html
        contents of a specified page or ask to insert a value into a database.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTTP Response: Similar to an HTTP request an HTTP response is also part of the HTTP protocol however it
        specifies a response from the server to the client in response to a request. A typical HTTP response would
        either state that the action was completed succesfully and then return the requested data or would outline an
        error which occured when processing a request.
