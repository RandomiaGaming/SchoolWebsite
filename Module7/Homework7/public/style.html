                <h3>Locations</h3>
                <p>Styles can be defined in many locations. In a separate .css file like what is done for most styles on
                    this website. In a &lt;style&gt; tag like what I used before migration to an external stylesheet. Or
                    they can be defined within the style attribute like what was done for the width and height of the
                    It's free real estate gif on the intrests.html page. Finally in very rare circumstances or on older
                    web pages styles can be defined with certain special use case attributes such as the bgcolor
                    attribute.</p>

                <h3>Selectors</h3>
                <p>There are tons of css selectors. Here are a few:</p>
                <table style="background-image: url(imgs/CageolasNic.jpg); background-size: cover; color: white;">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Selector</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>h1</td>
                        <td>Selects all h1 tags.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>.content-container</td>
                        <td>Selects all tags with the content-container class.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>#submit-button</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>div p</td>
                        <td>Selects all the p tags which are decendants of a div.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>div > p</td>
                        <td>Selects all p tags which are children of a div.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>h2 + p</td>
                        <td>Selects all p tags which are a sibling of an h2.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>input[type="email"]</td>
                        <td>Selects all input tags which have the attribute type="email".</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a:hover</td>
                        <td>Selects all a tags which are currently being hovered over.</td>
                    </tr>

                <h3>Box Model</h3>
                <p>The box model is how CSS and by extension web browsers determine how much space an element should
                    take up on the screen. It is based upon a collection of rectangles each one containing the last. The
                    smallest rectangle is the content of the element. This box contains the text of the element. Next is
                    the padding box, boarder box, and finally encapsulating all the others is the margine box.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Inheritance &amp; Specificity</h3>
                <p>In css there are times where a different value for a style is defined in different places. In these
                    situations there is a competition to see which style is actually used. Luckily there are rules for
                    which styles take priorety.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Styles marked with !important.</li>
                    <li>Styles applied with attributes.</li>
                    <li>Styles applied to an id.</li>
                    <li>Styles applied to a class.</li>
                    <li>Styles applied to a tag.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Additionally styles which apply to a child tag always take prioerty over those inherited from the
                    parent.
                    <br>
                    If two styles are of identical priority the one who was declared furthar down in the document takes
                    priority. Last seen &gt; first seen.
