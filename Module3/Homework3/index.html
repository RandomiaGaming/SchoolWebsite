            <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Definition of Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    Website: A website is a unified collection of pages designed to be viewed with a web browser. A
                    website
                    is
                    usually hosted by a server on a domain with various html files coorisponding to each page on the
                    website.
                    Websites also often contain css and javascript files to add additional functionality and
                    customization
                    to
                    each page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web Application: Similar to a website a web application is a set of files and code designed to be
                    viewed
                    in
                    a web browser. However, web applications are often more interactive offering features like dynamic
                    graphics
                    and audio instead of just static text and links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web Browser: A web browser is a standalone application designed to preforms various web and internet
                    related
                    tasks including downloading pages and facilitating communications with a web server as well as its
                    primary
                    function to render and display html pages and execute javascript in a contained environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web Server: A web server is an application designed to respond and process requests from a web
                    client or
                    web
                    browser. A typical web server is able to handle many differing types of requests to download content
                    or
                    modify database values in response to client requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTTP Request: The HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is a set of standards for how a server and
                    client
                    will
                    communicate and what requests/responses are allowed. An HTTP request is a part of the HTTP protocol
                    which
                    defines a request sent by the client to the server. A typical HTTP request might as the server for
                    the
                    html
                    contents of a specified page or ask to insert a value into a database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTTP Response: Similar to an HTTP request an HTTP response is also part of the HTTP protocol however
                    it
                    specifies a response from the server to the client in response to a request. A typical HTTP response
                    would
                    either state that the action was completed succesfully and then return the requested data or would
                    outline
                    an error which occured when processing a request.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The fundamental concept of frontend design is about using styles and links to organize the content
                    you
                    have in a readable and easy to find manner that allows users to quickly navigate to what they want
                    and
                    easily discover what your site has to offer. Good front end design is almost invisible and is so
                    seemless that the user doesn't notice it is there and is free to focus only on the content or task
                    they
                    are trying to do.
                </p>

                    <dd>Websites must be free from errors or warnings to ensure proper compatibility with accessability
                        tools and browsers.</dd>

                    <dt>Enjoyable</dt>
                    <dd>Websites must be engaging and enjoyable to use so users will want to come back.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Many beginners think that page layout tags like h1 h2 or p are disigned only to alter the size and
                    font
                    of text but this couldn't be farther from the truth. The styling of elements can always be changed
                    later
                    with css and classes. The point of different tags is to symbolize to the browers and to screen
                    readers
                    the intent of different peices of text or sections of content. These tags allow assistive
                    technologies
                    to know what content is the main body vs what is side thoughts or citations and therefore properly
                    organizing your content with the appropriate containers and tags is vital for users using assistive
                    technologies.
